## Dataset Description
### Source:
The data is from an anonymous organization's social media ad campaign and can be downloaded [here](#).

### Content:
The dataset `conversion_data.csv` contains 1,143 observations with the following features:
- **Age**: Age of the person who saw the ad.
- **Gender**: Gender of the person who saw the ad.
- **Interest**: A code representing the interest category from the person's Facebook profile.
- **Impressions**: Number of times the ad was displayed.
- **Clicks**: Number of times the ad was clicked.
- **Spent**: Amount paid by the company to show the ad.
- **Total Conversion**: Target variable—total number of inquiries about the product.

## Motivation
Social media ad campaigns are crucial for driving sales and conversions. This project aims to help businesses optimize their ad spending by predicting potential conversions based on key metrics. Insights can improve marketing strategies, especially for platforms like Google Adwords.

## Project Workflow
The project follows a structured pipeline:
1. **Data Ingestion**: Loading and verifying data integrity.
2. **Data Transformation**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and feature engineering.
3. **Model Prediction**: Building and evaluating regression models to predict conversions.

---

## Data Preprocessing
### Steps:
- **Data Cleaning**: Removing inconsistencies and handling missing values.
- **Feature Engineering**: Encoding gender and interest, scaling impressions, clicks, and spent.
- **Splitting Data**: Dividing into training and testing sets (e.g., 80-20 split).
